This book was built on a lot of hard work, most of which happened elsewhere. Without permission to republish from these folks, this book would still be in development. They have our gratitude and admiration.

So, reader, when you’ve completed a few CTFs, and you’re ready for more, reach out to this list. They like to support ambition, and they just might know someone who needs some talent.

# Contributing
If you want to make a contribution, simply commit your new markdown to the `master` branch and we'll take it from there. Gitbook has a fantastic [editor](https://github.com/GitbookIO/editor/releases) available to help preview your changes. We're always looking for new or refined content, so please send us your suggestions!

## Gitbook Usage
The CTF Field Guide is built with [Gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook), a command line tool for building books with Git and Markdown. You can use Gitbook to output the CTF Field Guide as a PDF, an eBook or a single, printable HTML page. Make sure you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and `npm` on your operating system, then install Gitbook and a few of its plugins:

```
npm install gitbook gitbook-plugin-ga gitbook-pdf ebook-convert -g
```

With Gitbook installed, you can run any of these commands from within the book directory:
* Generate an interactive, static website: ```gitbook build ./myrepo```
* Generate a single page website: ```gitbook build ./myrepo -f page```.
* Generate a PDF: ```gitbook pdf ./myrepo```. Requires [gitbook-pdf](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-pdf).
* Generate an eBook: ```gitbook ebook ./myrepo```. Requires [ebook-convert](http://manual.calibre-ebook.com/cli/ebook-convert.html).
